'''Module for calculating the results of Rufier's test.

The sum of heart rate measurements in three attempts (before exercise, immediately after and after a short rest)
ideally should be no more than 200 beats per minute.
We invite children to measure their heart rate for 15 seconds,
and we bring the result to beats per minute by multiplying by 4:
     S = 4 * (P1 + P2 + P3)
The further this result is from the ideal 200 hits, the worse.
Traditionally, tables are given for the value divided by 10.

Rufier Index
     IR = (S - 200) / 10
evaluated according to the table according to age:
          7-8             9-10              11-12              13-14          15+ (только для подростков!)
ex.    6.4 and less   4.9 and less      3.4 and less        1.9 and less             0.4 and less 
good   6.5 - 11.9     5 - 10.4          3.5 - 8.9           2 - 7.4                  0.5 - 5.9
sat.   12 - 16.9      10.5 - 15.4       9 - 13.9            7.5 - 12.4               6 - 10.9
weak   17 - 20.9      15.5 - 19.4       14 - 17.9           12.5 - 16.4              11 - 14.9
unsat. 21 and more    19.5 and more     18 and more         16.5 and more            15 and more

for all ages, the result of "failure" is 4 from "weak",
that from "satisfactory" by 5, and "good" from "beats" - by 5.5

so let's write a function ruffier_result (r_index, level) that will receive
the calculated Rufier index and the level of "fail" for the age of the test taker, and give the result

txt_res.append('''low.
